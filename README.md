### Things I have done Well
1. I have kept code as modular as possible defining component for each task.
2. Using Redux toolkit rather than traditional redux which can become complex and bottleneck in some of the complex cases for managing complex state.
3. Using Bootstrap with React Bootstrap so that i can use the classes from the bootstraps and also the component such as Modal,Form,Select from the React Bootstrap package.
4. Using Redux for managing global states so that it can be passed to different components and gives user a seamless experience.
5. Minimal use of external CSS as it can sometimes makes the code complicated so used bootstrap classses for flexing and other things.
6. Using interafaces for defining the types of the redux state so that the keys and values from the state can be accessed easily.

### Things I will try to improve
1. I would have applied user login and and login page so that the user can login and then the user will see the Viewer App.
2. I would have worked on the beautification of the app such that the table design,button designs and als the Navbar design.
3. I would have used Jest for Unit Testing.


### Feedbacks
1. The Planning page should have been explained more thoroughly as it a bit complicated and the user would have been confused in the first attempt.
